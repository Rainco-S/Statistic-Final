# Statistic-Final

The related data source of this homework is ordered not to be uploaded anywhere, so if you want to check [code.r](./code.r), you need to put "Beijing_Wanliu_data.csv" into the root directory of the code.

Also, there is a [GIF](./figures/PM25动态变化.gif) file which can not be put into LaTeX, so I uploaded it here in ordered to be visible.

You can run the [期末报告.tex](./2300010816+谭雪贻+2025秋季普通统计学期末报告.tex) file to produce the [期末报告.pdf](./2300010816+谭雪贻+2025秋季普通统计学期末报告.pdf) and check the originality and credibility. To be clear, you need to put the folder "figures" into the same root directory.
